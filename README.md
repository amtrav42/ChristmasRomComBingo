  Christmas RomCom Bingo
</h1>

This silly site is created to celebrate the joy of RomComs, and the code could easily be adapted for other strong generes with recurring themes

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```
    
1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
